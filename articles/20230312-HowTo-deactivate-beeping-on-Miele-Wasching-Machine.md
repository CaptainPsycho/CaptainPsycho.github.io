# HowTo deactivate beeping on Miele washing machine at end of run

We own a [Miele WSD323WPS D PWash](https://www.miele.de/e/w1-waschmaschine-frontlader-wsd323-wps-d-pwashund8kg-lotosweiss-11298480-p). After an update by the service technician it was beeping at the end of each washing run.

This was loud and annoying. To stop this sound do the following:

- select any washing program
- open the door
- press and hold the sensor button "Start / WÃ¤sche nachlegen"
- close the door
- wait until the button is lighted permanently, then stop pressing the button
- __P11__ length of beeping
  - press "Start"-button
  - _01_ 3x beeping on end of programm
  - _02_ beeping for 1 hour on end of programm
- __P12__
  - press "Start"-button
  - _00_ turn of beeping
  - _01_ beeping volume _normal_
  - _02_ beeping volume _high_
- at the end turn of washing machine
